## About Me

Hello :) 
I’m Manuela, a Colombian Master’s student in Development Economics in Paris, trying to make sense of how numbers, land, and power keep tripping over each other.

**Currently into:**
- R for delightfully messy real-world data (ggplot2, dplyr, “is this causal? …maybe” energy)
- Okay with SQL, wrestling with Stata,  idealizing a near future where I also know Python
- Anything agro-adjacent: land tenure drama, food systems, rural livelihoods, who eats and who doesn’t

I have mixed feelings about the development world's obsession with “proof”™ — the kind that only counts if it shows up in a neat regression table. It’s useful, but it can also be a way to ignore work that actually changes lives. I’m interested in playing that game well enough to get funding, while keeping a social, systems-based perspective so the goal stays clear: shifting material conditions for the people who need it, not just making indicators look pretty.

When I'm not buried in readings, I'm usually:
- digging through vinyl bins,
- getting lost in thrift shops,
- or accidentally turning a “small assignment” into a full research project.

If any of this overlaps with what you’re working on, feel free to lurk in my repos or say hi.
