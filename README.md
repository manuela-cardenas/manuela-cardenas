## About

Master's student in Development Economics in Paris, trying to make sense of how numbers, land, and power keep tripping over each other.

**Currently into:**
- R for delightfully messy real-world data (ggplot2, dplyr, “is this causal? …maybe”)
- Okay with SQL, wrestling with Stata, romantically idealizing a future where I also know Python
- Anything agro-adjacent: land tenure drama, food systems, rural livelihoods, who eats and who doesn’t

I have mixed feelings about the development world's obsession with “proof”, the kind that only counts if it’s in a regression table. It can be a nice tool, and also a neat way to ignore anything that doesn’t fit the spreadsheet. I’m interested in playing that game well enough to get funding, but twisting it toward what actually matters: shifting material conditions for people, not just making indicators look pretty.

When I'm not buried in readings, I'm usually:
- digging through vinyl bins,
- getting lost in thrift shops,
- or accidentally turning a “small assignment” into a full research project.
